MedLicense.com's website is increasingly becoming the resource on the Web for free Physician Med License information. MedLicense.com is visited on a weekly basis by our competition. They have recognized that we are the Industry Leaders. Our site is continually copied and plagiarized by these companies. Often, information from our site is posted "word for word" without changes onto theirs. If a new service, price, or an article appears on MedLicense.com, you can bet that the other companies will be sure to add that information to their website. We were the first to offer discounts to Hurricane Katrina Victims. MedLicense.com was the first to offer special rates to Military Physicians. MedLicense.com is the Industry Innovator. All others are simply playing catch up.</p>
