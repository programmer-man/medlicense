<p>MedLicense.com has decided to no longer accept contracts for the licensure process for the Territory of Puerto Rico. On a current client, the physician had to fly to Puerto Rico because the Medical Board is not accepting calls or responding to emails to check the status of his application. The Board informed him that they were in receipt of only 2 verifications of the 12 which had been sent to them. We provided confirmation and delivery receipt to the client which he then provided to the Representative at the Puerto Rico Medical Board. The response... We don't have them . Until the PR Medical Board comes under new management or changes their mail system, we are not going to accept new contracts for Puerto Rico Licensure services.</p>
