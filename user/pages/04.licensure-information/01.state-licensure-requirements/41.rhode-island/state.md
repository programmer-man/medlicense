<h2 id="mcetoc_1ce9h7ji20">Additional Rhode Island Medical Board Information:</h2>
<p>The Rhode Island Medical Board has mandated the use of FCVS. This can add some time to the licensure process. However, we have seen the The Rhode Island Medical Board issue the license without receive the packet once we provide proof that the FCVS packet is in process. This is at the descretion of the The Rhode Island Medical Board.</p>
