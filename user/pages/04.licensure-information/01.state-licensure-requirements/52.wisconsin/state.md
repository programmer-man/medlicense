<p>The Wisconsin Medical Board has a typical process. The Wisconsin Medical Board does verify employment and privileges. It takes the Wisconsin Medical Board 2 to 4 weeks to process applications after receipt. After submitting the Wisconsin Medical License Application, the Wisconsin Medical Board will process and notify the physician of the deficiencies necessary to complete the application within a couple of weeks through the online Status Report System. Verifications typically take 2-3 weeks to reach the physician's file after being received by the Wisconsin Medical Board's mail room. The Wisconsin Medical Board provides some access to the licensure analysts. The staff is helpful and pleasant to work with. Mail loss is usually not a problem with the Wisconsin Medical Board.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Medical Board does not offer a Temporary License. Fingerprint Cards are also required and have to be submitted to IBT / L-1 after the application is filed. MedLicense.com is experiencing licensure times of 2 1/2 to 4 months for the issuance of the Wisconsin Medical License for most Physicians.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ce9oest20">Additional Wisconsin Medical Board Licensing Information:</h2>
<p>The Wisconsin Medical Board typically has a straight forward process. However, if a physician has significant issues with his/her training (completing it) or any type of significant negative issue, the Wisconsin Medical Board can require that the physician submit to an "Oral Exam" which is given at the Board. The Oral Exam primarily consists of various scenarios in which the physician must provide his/her diagnosis and course of treatment. Our clients have found this exam extremely Arbitrary. If a physician fails it, he is not provided the correct answer to the questions so that he/she can ascertain by what standard he/she was judged. In 11 years, not one client who was required to take this exam passed it. As such it seems that this exam may be a means to an end for the Wisconsin Medical Board.</p>
