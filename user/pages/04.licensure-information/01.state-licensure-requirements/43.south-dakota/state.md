<h2 id="mcetoc_1ce9l03p30">Additional South Dakota Medical Board Information:</h2>
<p>The South Dakota Medical Board, unlike most Medical Boards, directly verifies all verifications. Because of this, the process can be artificially delayed due to the Board's inability to locate the correct contact information for each verifying source.
